# My_Comp-Programming_Template
My competitive programming templates. <br>
A majority of the algorithm implementations in there aren't mine. Most are either from Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen or from USACO.guide (Like Benq's DSU). 
The Lazy templated prop-segment tree **probably (I have high confidence)** works.<br>
The Lazy lazy set lazy prop seg tree I am less sure of, especially if you are using the .set() function.
