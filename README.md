# My_Comp-Programming_Template
My competitive programming template. <br>
A majority of the algorithm implementations in there aren't mine. Most are either from Competitive Programmer's Handbook by Antti Laaksonen or from USACO.guide (Like Benq's DSU). 
The Lazy prop-segment tree **probably** works but I'm not 100% confident. It's worked the couple times I've used it.
